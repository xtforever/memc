Implement use-after-free protection

  Problem: handles are re-used in m_create.
  - p=m_create(...); .. m_free(p); p1 = m_create(...) : p and p1 have the same value
  Error: m_buf(p,0) will work!

  Solution:
     reduce handles to 24bit and fill the remaining seven bits with a bit pattern
     that changes on every call of m_free.
